# 🏥 Healthcare Analytics Dashboard – Tableau + SQL

## 📌 Overview
The Healthcare Analytics Dashboard provides a comprehensive view of hospital operations by analyzing patient demographics, admission trends, medical conditions, billing patterns, and doctor performance. Built using Tableau and supported by SQL analysis, the dashboard enables hospitals to track key KPIs, identify bottlenecks, and make data-driven decisions to improve patient care and operational efficiency.

The project uses cleaned healthcare data to uncover patterns in long-stay patients, high-risk medical cases, admission types, billing outliers, and resource utilization across multiple hospitals.

## 🚨 Problem Statement
Hospitals handle large volumes of patient and operational data but often lack the ability to analyze it effectively. Critical information—such as admission types, medical conditions, doctor workload, and patient stay duration—is scattered and underutilized. This leads to inefficient resource allocation, increased patient wait times, poor visibility into risk groups, and difficulty improving patient outcomes.

This project solves the problem by:
- Consolidating patient-level data
- Performing SQL-based medical and operational analysis
- Building an interactive Tableau dashboard for real-time insights
- Highlighting critical KPIs such as long-stay patients, high-billing cases, and admission trends

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Tableau** – Dashboard, KPIs, drill-down analysis  
- **SQL (MySQL)** – Data extraction, slicing, and pattern identification  
- **Excel** – Data cleaning, preprocessing  
- **Python (Optional)** – Additional EDA (if needed)

## 🔍 Key Insights
- A majority of patients admitted in 2024 were treated for chronic conditions like Diabetes and Heart Disease.
- Several departments show a high proportion of long-stay patients (>10 days), indicating possible operational inefficiencies.
- Billing amounts vary significantly between medical conditions, with a few conditions contributing to the highest billing.
- Some doctors handle significantly more patients, showing workload imbalance across hospitals.
- Specific hospitals consistently have higher admission rates on the same dates, indicating capacity pressure.

---

## 💡 Recommendations
- Redistribute doctor workloads in hospitals where patient-to-doctor ratios are high.  
- Implement process improvements in departments with frequent long-stay patients (e.g., early diagnosis, faster testing).  
- Review high-billing medical conditions to ensure cost transparency and identify cost-saving opportunities.  
- Increase staffing during peak monthly admission periods to reduce waiting times.  
- Track chronic conditions more closely and introduce preventive care programs to reduce readmissions.
